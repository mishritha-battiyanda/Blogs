Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the
presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects
such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be
rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among
the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers
according to W3C specifications.
